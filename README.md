Groups in the Fediverse

Fedigroup lets you create a group and then mention it in the fediverse, the group would then boost your message and also store its contents for search.
There is also a web UI that lets you search within groups you are a member of (search is currently being implemented).

The server is currently in alpha stage and many critical features don't work yet. Contributions are welcome!

### Features

* You can login using a Mastodon-API supported account and create a group
* You can follow that group and it will boost mentions of it to other people.egigro
* The group stores the message in the database

### What does not work yet
* Search
* Pagination
* group pages
* Attachment save/display
* Posting from within the webui
* Like/share from within the webui
* Delete activity
* Edit acttivity
* Edit existing group
* Delete / archive group
* Moderation (delete/block/defedate)
 Lots of elements not clickable (dates, avatars)

### General info
* All groups are public

## Motivation
I was trying to implement: https://github.com/yuforium/activitypub-docs
or: https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/feps/fep-1b12.md
While being functional

I saw this and thought it was cool: https://github.com/wmurphyrd/guppe
But I want to have also a way to search back in groups.

Code contribution would be appreciated!
